Normalisation  Tradeup

1. Introduction
Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy, avoid update anomalies, and ensure data integrity.
The TradeUp database has been normalized up to Third Normal Form (3NF) to support efficient product exchanges, purchases, payments, and auditing.


2. First Normal Form (1NF)

Rule:
A table is in First Normal Form (1NF) if:
- Each attribute contains atomic values
- There are no repeating groups
- Each record can be uniquely identified

Non-1NF Example (Incorrect Design):

ORDERS(
  order_id,
  product1,
  product2,
  product3
)

Correct 1NF Design (TradeUp):

ORDERS(
  order_id,
  user_id,
  order_date
)

ORDER_ITEMS(
  order_item_id,
  order_id,
  product_id
)

Explanation:
In TradeUp, repeating product groups were removed by creating the ORDER_ITEMS table.
This ensures that each field stores a single value.


3. Second Normal Form (2NF)

Rule:
A table is in Second Normal Form (2NF) if:
- It is already in 1NF
- There are no partial dependencies

Non-2NF Example (Incorrect Design):

ORDER_ITEMS(
  order_id,
  product_id,
  product_name,
  price
)

Correct 2NF Design (TradeUp):

PRODUCTS(
  product_id,
  name,
  price
)

ORDER_ITEMS(
  order_item_id,
  order_id,
  product_id
)

Explanation:
Product attributes depend only on product_id and were moved to the PRODUCTS table.
This removes partial dependency and satisfies 2NF.


4. Third Normal Form (3NF)

Rule:
A table is in Third Normal Form (3NF) if:
- It is already in 2NF
- There are no transitive dependencies

Non-3NF Example (Incorrect Design):

ORDERS(
  order_id,
  user_id,
  username,
  email
)

Correct 3NF Design (TradeUp):

USERS(
  user_id,
  username,
  email
)

ORDERS(
  order_id,
  user_id
)

Explanation:
User information is stored only in the USERS table.
ORDERS references USERS using a foreign key, eliminating transitive dependencies.
